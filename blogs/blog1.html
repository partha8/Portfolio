          In this article, we’ll try to understand “declarative programming” and
          “imperative programming” and help a beginner understand how ReactJS
          makes it easier to build UIs.
        </p>
        <h2>What are imperative and declarative programming?</h2>
        <p>On Wikipedia, we will find these definitions:</p>
        <p>
          <i>
            Imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses
            statements that change a program's state.
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>
            Declarative programming is a programming paradigm…that expresses the
            logic of a computation without describing its control flow.
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          The definitions do not make much sense if you are a beginner and do
          not have any formal CS education. So let us understand them using some
          code examples!
        </p>
        <h2>Imperative Programming</h2>
        <p>
          Let us make an app that asks the user their name and give the output
          on the browser.
        </p>
        <p><strong>HTML file:</strong></p>
        <img class="inside-blog-images" src="./images/blog1/pic1.JPG" alt="" />
        <p><strong>JavaScript file:</strong></p>
        <div class="image-container"></div>
        <img src="./images/blog1/pic2.JPG" alt="" class="inside-blog-images" />
        <p>Let's understand the above code.</p>
        <p>
          1. In the HTML file, as highlighted, we declare the h1 element, inside
          which we create span tags with class=username.
          <br />
          2. Now coming inside the JavaScript file, we declare two variables.
          Variable "username" gets access to the span element, which lets us
          manipulate the DOM later, and "askName" stores the input we get from
          the user.
          <br />
          3. To get the output on the browser, we use the innerText property to
          set the text content, i.e., the user’s name, from the “askName”
          variable.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >You can see that we must follow a set of steps to get the desired
            output.</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          In simple terms, imperative programming is like you instructing your
          friend on how to make a good Margherita pizza for you. You explain the
          flow to them, and they will listen to you religiously.
        </p>
        <h2>Declarative Programming</h2>
        <p>Now let us code the same app in ReactJS.</p>
        <img src="./images/blog1/pic5.JPG" alt="" class="inside-blog-images" />
        <p>Let's understand the above code.</p>
        <p>
          1. Once we set up our React app, we declare a variable "askName" which
          stores the input we get from the user inside the App.js file.
          <br />
          2. Next, we place the variable in the h1 element, which is present
          inside the return statement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here we are not bothered with the steps. We simply say “Hey, we have
          the variable “askName” and I want it inside h1 element.” ReactJS will
          handle the flow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Simply put declarative programming is like asking your friend to make
          a Margherita pizza without being bothered about the process/recipe.
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          The logic in both the code gets the username and puts it on the
          browser page, but the major difference is that the React example never
          touches a DOM element.
          <br />
          When writing React, we should not think of how we want to accomplish a
          result, but instead what the component should look like in its new
          state or where we want our new variable. In the case of the imperative
          example, we had to manipulate the DOM directly. We had to think of how
          we want to accomplish the task.
